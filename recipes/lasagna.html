    Homemade Lasagna is a family favorite and a great way to feed a crowd.
</p>
<p>
    In this classic lasagna recipe, sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy filling, a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then baked until bubbly and browned.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
    <li><strong>Cheese Filling:</strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li> 
    <li><strong>Meat:</strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor. </li>
    <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it is easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you would prefer). </li>
    <li><strong>Spinach (variation):</strong> Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol> 
    <li> <strong>Boil pasta:</strong> In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below. </li> 
    <li> <strong>Prepare meat sauce:</strong>Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture: </strong>Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer & bake:</strong>Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
</ol>
