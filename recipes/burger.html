    Close your eyes, and picture the perfect hamburger.
</p>
<p>
    It is a classic all-American recipe for mouthwatering burgers that can be cooked on the grill, on the stovetop, as thick 1/3 pound patties, or as ultra-thin griddle patties.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
    <li><strong>Ground chuck:</strong> We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li> 
    <li><strong>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs:</strong> he best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
    <li><strong>Worcestershire sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it is easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you would prefer). </li>
    <li><strong>Egg & Milk :</strong> To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol> 
    <li> <strong>First, </strong> set out a <strong>large mixing bowl</strong> and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices. Use your hands to combine until the mixture is thoroughly smooth.</li> 
    <li> <strong>Next, </strong>press the meat down in the bowl into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 - 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties or 12 thin griddle patties.</li>
    <li><strong>Then, </strong>preheat the <strong>grill</strong> or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F. I love using a cast-iron skillet for getting that drool-worthy caramelized sear on the burgers.</li>
    <li><strong>Lastly, </strong>Homemade cooked hamburger patties will keep well tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, or in an airtight container, in the fridge for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.</li>
</ol>
